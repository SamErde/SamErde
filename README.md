### Hi there! 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on :blue_heart: PowerShell, Active Directory, Azure AD, Microsoft 365, Exchange Server, Intune, and Defender for everything. 
- 🌱 I’m continually learning to be a better husband and father, and when I have time: Azure, Git, Docker, Ansible, Terraform, security, and trying to catch my Linux knowledge up to its Windows counterpart. :penguin:
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on PowerShell, Azure AD, IAM and hybrid identity, Ubiquiti Dream Machine tools, and useful projects for Synology NAS. 
- 💬 Ask me about Windows, Azure Active Directory, anything between the two, and most of all: coffee! :coffee:
- 📫 How to reach me: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SamErde), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samerde/), or [Server Fault](https://serverfault.com/users/49571/sturdyerde) 
- 😄 Pronouns: he/his/him

YOU matter! If you or someone you care about is affected by depression, anxeity, or any other mental health challenge, don't wait and don't be afraid to reach out. [NAMI](https://www.nami.org/Your-Journey) and your doctor are a great place to start, or send a message if you just need someone to listen. :yellow_heart:
