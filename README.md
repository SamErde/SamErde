### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on some PowerShell modules that help you stay secure and work smarter. Check out [Locksmith](https://github.com/TrimarcJake/Locksmith) and my pinned repos below.  
- ðŸ’¬ Let's chat about Active Directory, Entra ID (Azure Active Directory), Microsoft 365, Microsoft Defender XDR, and PowerShell!  
- ðŸ“« You can reach me at [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SamErde), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samerde/), or [Server Fault](https://serverfault.com/users/49571/sturdyerde)  

You truly matter! If you or someone you care about is affected by depression, anxiety, or any other mental health challenge, don't wait and don't be afraid to reach out. [NAMI](https://www.nami.org/Your-Journey) and your doctor are a great place to start. Send a message if you just need someone to listen. :yellow_heart:
