# 👋🏻 Hi there!

👨‍💻 I'm currently working on PowerShell-based tools to make life easier for defenders and operations teams. The projects I am actively contributing these days focus largely on Active Directory, Defender XDR, Entra ID, Intune, Microsoft 365, and Windows Server:

 - 🔐 [Locksmith](https://github.com/TrimarcJake/Locksmith): A small tool built (by @JakeHildreth) to find and fix common misconfigurations in Active Directory Certificate Services.
 - 🔥 [Maester](https://github.com/Maester365/Maester): A PowerShell based test automation framework to help you stay in control of your Microsoft 365 security configuration.
 - 🪪 [Entra PowerShell](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/entra-powershell): A PowerShell module that makes it easier for Entra ID administrators to manage their tenant.
 - 💪 [PSPreworkout](https://github.com/SamErde/PSPreworkout): A special mix of tools to help jump start your PowerShell sessions.
 - 🥒 [DLLPickle](#): Coming Soon
