### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on :blue_heart: PowerShell, Exchange Server, Active Directory, Azure AD, Microsoft 365, Windows Server deployments, and SolarWinds Orion. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m continually learning to be a husband and father, and when I have time: Azure, Git, Docker, Ansible, Terraform, security, and trying to catch my Linux knowledge up to its Windows counterpart. :penguin:
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on PowerShell, Azure AD, IAM and hybrid identity, Ubiquiti Dream Machine tools, and useful projects for Synology NAS. 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Windows, Active Directory, anything between the two, and most of all: coffee! :coffee:
