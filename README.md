# 👋🏻 Hi there!

👨‍💻 I'm currently working on PowerShell-based tools to make life easier for defenders and operations teams. The projects I am actively contributing these days focus largely on Active Directory, Defender XDR, Entra ID, Intune, Microsoft 365, and Windows Server:

- 🥒 [DLLPickle](https://github.com/SamErde/DllPickle): A module that pre-loads the latest Microsoft Authentication Library so you can use any modules dependent on MSAL without worrying about the DLL version conflict that can prevent you from connecting to Azure, Microsoft Graph, Exchange Online, Teams, and more.
- 💪 [PSPreworkout](https://github.com/SamErde/PSPreworkout): A special mix of tools to help jump start your PowerShell sessions.
- 🔐 [Locksmith](https://github.com/TrimarcJake/Locksmith): A small tool built (by @JakeHildreth) to find and fix common misconfigurations in Active Directory Certificate Services.
 - 🔥 [Maester](https://github.com/Maester365/Maester): A PowerShell based test automation framework to help you stay in control of your Microsoft 365 security configuration.
 - 🪪 [Entra PowerShell](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/entra-powershell): A PowerShell module that makes it easier for Entra ID administrators to manage their tenant.
