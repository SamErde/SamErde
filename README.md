### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Locksmith](https://github.com/TrimarcJake/Locksmith), [No Cert Left Behind](https://github.com/SamErde/No-Cert-Left-Behind), [The Cleaners](https://github.com/SamErde/TheCleaners), and [PowerShell Pre-Workout](https://github.com/SamErde/PowerShell-Pre-Workout).  
- ðŸ’¬ Let's chat about Active Directory, Entra ID (Azure Active Directory), Microsoft 365, Exchange Server, Intune, and Microsoft Defender.  
- ðŸ“« You can reach me at [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SamErde), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samerde/), or [Server Fault](https://serverfault.com/users/49571/sturdyerde)  

You truly matter! If you or someone you care about is affected by depression, anxiety, or any other mental health challenge, don't wait and don't be afraid to reach out. [NAMI](https://www.nami.org/Your-Journey) and your doctor are a great place to start. Send a message if you just need someone to listen. :yellow_heart:
