### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on :blue_heart: PowerShell, Exchange Server, Active Directory and Azure AD, Windows Server deployments, and SolarWinds Orion . 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about life...and when I have time, also learn about: Docker, Ansible, code management with Git, and trying to catch my Linux knowledge up to its Windows counterpart. :penguin:
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on PowerShell, Ubiquiti Dream Machine improvements, and useful projects for Synology NAS. 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Windows, Active Directory, anything between the two, and most of all: coffee! :coffee:
